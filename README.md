# SmartCodingApplication

I have created this repository for Smart Coding Full-Stack developer course admission process.

There is only one file in the repository:
  - python_assignment.py (for Python assessment)

I have sent you the following files via e-mail due to privacy reasons:
  - RB_resume.html (for HTML/CSS assessment)
  - RB_resume_styles.css (for HTML/CSS assessment)
